listPhoneDictTiming = shows computational time when using a list of tuples from word to pronunciation

mapPhoneDictTiming = shows comp time when using a HashMap instead

multPhone = shows increase in no. of passed tests when supporting multiple pronunciations for a word

usingARPABETtype = switching from representing arpabet with strings to its own data type to implement arrays. 
                  Initialisation of dict is noticably slower (~5 secs -> ~40 secs)

fuzzy1 = Threshold: 5. 
         Number of tests passing incresed from 412 -> 429 out of 577
         Many exceptions of "Exception: Prelude.minimum: empty list" which indicates word is not in dictionary
         Many failed tests are words where it is expected to pronounce individual letters like "is"
            (pronouncing "i" and "s" seperately can be similar to "eyes")
         Possible to add extra test cases where given words like "he will", the program converts it to "he'll" 

fuzzy2 = Seperated tests that do not pass because they don't exist in dictionary. 431/480 homophoneTable passed
         Code has not changed from fuzzy1 
         Most failed test cases are either words not in the dictionary or words that have R which is silent in British


fuzzy match, multiple words, dialect, rhyme, spoonerisms

former spoken on the radio
 |      |
 past   oral   = pastoral


 splitNopt = split into multiple words

 ["past","oral"] and ["pastoral"] = true

 homophone of charades is a charade of homophones


 ghci> homophone ["in","close"] ["enclose"]
    True
    
current implementation: takes 2 words and checks if it is homophone

possible implementation: takes a string and creates homophones
   - exceedingly more computationally heavy if fuzzy matching is implemented
      (literally have to check every word in the dictionary and output top 10 ish choices)


["anele"] ["an","eel"] -- anele not in dict

["key","naps"] ["kneecaps"] -- spoonerisms. convert to arpabet then swap
["tidied"] ["tie","deed"] -- fuzzy homophone. tidied doesn't exist in dict

think abt usage of this other than crossword
